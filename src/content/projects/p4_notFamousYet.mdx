  Idea was to create a place where small just getting started entrepreneurs,
  businesses, DIY Etsy Crafters, [anyone trying to network] could connect. Most
  businesses start from tiny, unknown entities and hope to make it big or at
  least enjoy the journey. This hobby project is a place for all those future
  famous people.

  Project is still pretty young. The next big step is to finish the first
  release.
