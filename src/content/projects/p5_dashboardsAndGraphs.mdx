  Found an opportunity to help hospital departments with how they report data
  and performance at quarterly Patient Saftey and Clinical Quality meetings.
  Co-developed a standardized, complex excel dashboard to help departments track
  monthly performance on their focus metrics. Also created graphs for each
  metric that would automatically update upon new monthly data entered.
</ProjectSectionIconGroup>

<ProjectSectionIconGroup iconInfo="tools" sectionHeader="Under The Hood">
  Excel VBA Macros Department Manager/Director view was protected and only
  allowed monthly raw data to be entered. Super User view could manipulate the
  dashboard shell to add/remove/edit metrics. We developed VBA for the super
  users to quickly scaffold out each metrics graph after any edits were made.

  web based solution
