  Found an opportunity to help hospital departments with how they report data
  and performance at monthly Patient Saftey and Clinical Quality meetings.
  Co-developed a standardized, complex excel dashboard to help departments track
  monthly performance on their focus metrics. Also created graphs for each
  metric that would automatically update upon new monthly data entered.

    'Department Manager/Director view was protected and only allowed monthly raw data to be entered'
  }
  {
    'Super User view could manipulate the dashboard shell to add/remove/edit metrics'
  }

    'We developed VBA for the super users to quickly scaffold out each metrics graph after any edits were made'
  }
